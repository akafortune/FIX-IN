Look to the bottom
I've given you a layer of bricks to build
Very useful for blocking balls
but they can be pretty fragile...
In Build Phase you can use resources to build bricks
Look to the top right
You can see how many resources you have to build with
Each Row has different costs for building
You can see this on the right side of each row
I'll be nice and give you enough to build out that bottom row
